# DQN-CartPole
PyTorch and Keras implementations of DQN for the atari game CartPole.
The training needs a lot of time and after 5 hours of training was able to survive upto just 20 frames, but if trained on a setup with a decent GPU, the network plays the game better than an average human.
The agent plays randomly for the first 10,000 moves and then starts to train the DQN with the data collected
